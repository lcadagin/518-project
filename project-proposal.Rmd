Project Proposal:

What am I doing?
- I am recreating my resume with R. 

Why am I doing it?
- Constantly reformatting my resume everytime I want to add something is exhausting and tedious. I want to have a better system for myself. I also want a resume that is visually appealing and helps me stand out to employers.


How am I doing it?
- I tend to use either the {datadrivencv} package or the {pagedown} package, I have not decided yet. 


How will I know that I am are successful?
- I will know that I am successful if my end product is a resume that is easily editable and visually appealing to my eye.
